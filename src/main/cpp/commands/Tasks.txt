Some examples, but the ones in the code (HoodSubsystem, TurretSubsystem) are easier, since you have to completely build these ground up

While Y is pressed, run Fire

Fire
- ParallelCommandGroup
- Runs HomeTarget, CyclerPrepare, and CyclerLaunch

HomeTarget
- Sets flywheel speed, hood angle, and turret angle to correct positions based on limelight feeder
- Sets pointer that CyclerLaunch uses to true AND DOESNT END so speeds and angles are accurately maintained

CyclerPrepare
- Requires cycler
- Drives the turntable until a specific absolute encoder position
- Sets pointer that CyclerLaunch uses to true AND ENDS (important to allow CyclerLaunch to take over)

CyclerLaunch
- Requires cycler
- Drives turntable constantly into feeder
- Runs feeder
- Runs only if m_cycler_ready and m_shooting_ready, a pointer that's passed
