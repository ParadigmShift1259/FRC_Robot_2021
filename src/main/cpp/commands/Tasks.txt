Command resources here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/commands.html
Some examples, but the ones in the code (HoodSubsystem, TurretSubsystem) are easier, since you have to completely build these ground up

New commands (probably) needed (Also just good for practice for now)
- IntakeRelease
- FlywheelIdle
    Requires flywheel
    RunCommand that maintains the flywheel at a constant kIdleRPM
- FlywheelRamp
    Requires flywheel
    RunCommand that maintains the flywheel at a higher constant kRampRPM
- Shoot
    Requires flywheel, turret, and hood
    RunCommand that runs the flywheel at a designated speed (put constant for now) for a time constant kShootTime
- TurretControl
    Requires turret
    RunCommand that accepts an X and Y input (for rotation), converts it into rotation, and calls turret.TurnToRelative()
