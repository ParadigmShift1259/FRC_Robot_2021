Command resources here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/commands.html
Some examples, but the ones in the code (HoodSubsystem, TurretSubsystem) are easier, since you have to completely build these ground up

New commands (probably) needed (Also just good for practice for now)
- FlywheelIdle
    Requires flywheel
    RunCommand that maintains the flywheel at a constant kIdleRPM
- FlywheelRamp
    Requires flywheel
    RunCommand that maintains the flywheel at a higher constant kRampRPM
- TurretControl
    Requires turret
    RunCommand that accepts an X and Y input (for rotation), converts it into rotation, and calls turret.TurnToRelative() 
    
Official structure for firing:

While Y is pressed, run Fire

Fire
- ParallelCommandGroup
- Runs CyclerReady and Conditional Command at the same time
    - ConditionalCommand
    - Runs ShootBalls or HomeTarget based on whether m_cycler_ready and m_shooting_ready, a pointer that's passed into HomeTarget

ShootBalls
- ParallelCommandGroup
- Runs HomeTarget and CyclerLaunch at the same time

Default Commands
- Turret
    - Conditional Command
    - Maintains last robot angle driven OR if there are inputs, runs TurretControl
- Flywheel
    - FlywheelIdle
- Servo
    - Set to 0
- Cycler
    - Runs CyclerAgitation


Fire -> CyclerReady, ShootBalls, HomeTarget
ShootBalls -> HomeTarget, CyclerLaunch

CyclerAgitation
TurretMaintain
TurretControl
